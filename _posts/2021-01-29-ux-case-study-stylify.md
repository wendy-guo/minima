<h3>context</h3>

As an avid online shopper who is obsessed with clothes, I found my closet growing rapidly in size. Sometimes I realize that I continue to buy similar clothing pieces, only because I can't keep track of what I already own. Some items may only be worn for certain occasions, and may be forgotten after one wear. I want to keep an inventory of my entire collection so I can get more wear out of everything.

<h3>Findings</h3>

How much of your closet do you believe you haven't worn in the last year? When asked this question by German moving company Movinga, on average surveyors in the US and Canada answered 43% and 39% respectively. In reality, the researched values proved to be 82% and 79%. That's a delusion value of 39% and 40% for the two countries. It is evident that people are not knowledgable about their own closets, which often leads to buying more clothes and promoting fast fashion.

<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>

Looking for exisiting products, I went on the hunt for apps that will manage my clothing collection. There was only a few, most of which were not very developed. I picked one that was well-rounded to analyze.

<h6 style="text-decoration-color:#FECDA2;">PROBLEM</h6>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

It's hard to keep track of our clothing collection. Due to the sheer amount of clothes, picking out outfits on a daily basis sometimes becomes a daunting task, and people often resort to the same pool of outfits. In addition, not knowing your closet well may lead to excessive shopping, which in turn contributes to the fast fashion inductry and negatively impacts the environment.

<h3>Goals</h3>
To solve the problem, we can formulate two main goals to achieve:

##### 1. Keep track of every piece of clothing

- makes it easy to find and style later
- prevents buying pieces that have similar "functions"

##### 2. Make it easy and fast to come up with outfits

- reduces amount of time spent deciding what to wear each day
- finds clothing for any occasion

<h6 style="text-decoration-color:#FECDA2;">SOLUTION</h6>

<h3>Custom Tags for Items</h3>

By adding custom tags to clothing pieces, it is easier to put together outfits as we can filter by these tags later. Users can define their own tags, which can range from season (summer, winter, etc.) to style (cute, preppy, etc.). The app also automatically assigns colours to each item, which allows users to filter by colour as well.

<h3>Creating Style Boards</h3>

The creation of style boards allows users to refer back to them when getting dressed for any occasion. It saves time by providing pre-defined outfits to choose from, and can also function as a moodboard.

<h3>Final UI</h3>

<h6 style="text-decoration-color:#FECDA2;">REFLECTION</h6>
This was my first UX case study, and it taught me a lot about design processes. It took longer than initally planned, as I was frequently revising my designs and going through different iterations. I also became good friends with Figma :)

If I had more time, I would like to integrate a social aspect into the app. Users can view other users' profiles and perhaps even style outfits for one another. It would add more excitement into dressing from your current closet and ease excessive buying.
