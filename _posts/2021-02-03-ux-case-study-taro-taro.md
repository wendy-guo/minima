overview

app to log meals and keep track of nutrion info (vitamin intake, proteins, carbs)


problem:
(overall problem)

nutritional education, healthy lifestyle, conscioud of what we are feeding our bodies (we are what we eat)
a lot of food tracking apps out there focus on weight loss. eating healthy is associated with weight loss. 
it adds to the mindset that a "normal" weight means healthy. want to advocate for good nutrition, by spreeading the importance of nutrition.

> taro is what taro eats
taro is our mascot 
(shapeshifts based on food that user inputs (ingredient that was eaten the most that day; randomly picks an ingredient from inputted))

problems with exiisting apps
many meals you make yourself do not exist in the app, it is tedious to input it each time

custom meals/recipes; no need to log same thing everytime

also acts as a cookbook, if you don't know what to make
